# P5 Game - The Alchemist

This game is intended for the demo of our business plan in the P5 RA MAN Insan Cendekia Sumedang "Entrepreneur".




## A Little of Backstory...
So here we were again—back in the P5 RA, this time with a fresh theme, entrepreneurship!
Initially, we didn’t plan on proceeding into the creative industry, such as games, animation, or anything like that. But our first idea turned out to be bad (and honestly, pretty lame), and after facing multiple debates during our pitch preparation, we've decided to change our business. We ended up building a game studio focused on educational games. To enhance our pitch, my friend Pascal and I agreed to create a demo game with chemistry as its core theme.

We had only three hours to build it, and at that point, I didn’t even have experience with any game engines. So I coded the game in Python, which isn't commonly used for game development. The result? A very simple, unfinished prototype. But it served its purpose, a working concept to support our presentation.

But I'm very proud of it because that demo actually gave our pitch real color and received enthusiastic feedback from the audience. Yay!
